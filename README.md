# üëã Hi, my name is C√Ærlan Ion
Connect with me: [GitHub](https://github.com/joxnah) | [Email](ionutx2008@gmail.com)

I'm a passionate and focused Computer Science student at CEITI College of Informatics. My core programming experience and strongest interest lie in C#.

I enjoy turning ideas into functional applications and am currently expanding my skill set to focus on two exciting areas:

Learning .NET: Deepening my knowledge of the C# ecosystem for building robust, modern applications.

Exploring Unity: Utilizing C# to delve into game development and interactive experiences.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to interesting projects!
